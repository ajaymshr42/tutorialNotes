installing it can be  tricky as it requires separate compiler which requires few steps 

ensure the folder where you are performing this does not contain spaces 

then 



LINUX
Download ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz and:

$ tar -xzf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
$ cd ta-lib/
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
If you build TA-Lib using make -jX it will fail but that's OK! Simply rerun make -jX followed by [sudo] make install.

Note: if your directory path includes spaces, the installation will probably fail with No such file or directory errors.



finally 


pip install TA-Lib
