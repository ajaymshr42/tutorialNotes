sample code looks like somethiing this



<?php

error_reporting (E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
require_once '/var/www/html/s3/vendor/autoload.php';


use Aws\S3\S3Client;

// Instantiate the S3 client with your AWS credentials
$s3 = S3Client::factory(array(
	'region'=>'us-east-1',
	'version'=>'latest',
    'credentials' => array(
        'key'    => 'YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID',
        'secret' => 'YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY',
    )
));

$result = $s3->listBuckets();

foreach ($result['Buckets'] as $bucket) {
    echo $bucket['Name'] . "\n";
}
?>

apart from this they say that ~/.aws/credentials contains default ccredentials where you can save your amazon aws s3 credentials and 
then access through sdk whatever you want only this method works me because it needs nothing but the fatcory method
