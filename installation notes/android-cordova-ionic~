android-intallation

download android studio and extract in desired folder for installation.......
finally comes the most exhaustive and hectic part adding it to the environment path variables 

i spent almost two days searching for the right way to do it and finally got the answer to my question using .bashrc file

open .bashrc file in home using your favorite text editor i used nano

execute 
$nano .bashrc


this opens your .bashrc file , remember not to mess with it too much because this may cause some terrible problems in your system

just add this two simple lines at the end or at begining or anywhere but not inside some control flow structure already processing some function 

export ANDROID_HOME=/home/'username'/Android/Sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools

in this $HOME can be added to indicate /home/'username' in first line 
remember you have to give the path where you installed android , like i installed in my home directory so i provided that path

also check whether android-sdk is saved in this Android/Sdk
if not check the directory name and provide that name for the export in .bashrc

once you are done with this steps you can execute android command from anywhere

now stepping to ionic !



ionic-intallation

you should have npm installer installed in order to install the ionic framework in your system

$ sudo npm install -g ionic

your can start a app named 'todo' with initially as blank in desired directory using following command(you can also initialize your app as tab or others , see ionicframework official website for this)

$ ionic start todo blank

checkout the contents of todo app (see directories and have a pretty gasp of what is where)

$ cd todo && ls


adding platforms


$ ionic platform add ios

$ ionic platform add android


emulating in virtual devices

$ ionic build ios
$ ionic emulate ios

$ ionic build android
$ ionic emulate android



Note : your should have cordova telemetry on in order to emulate and build application fro different platforms while using cordova plugins
run this command

 cordova telemetry on
