first of all check whether python virtual environment is working or not
 if not then install by typing


sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

then do 

virtualenv  rest-api

source rest-api/bin/activate

after this you will be inside a virtual environment then create desired directory like

mkdir ~/rest-app

cd ~/rest-app



now create your sample file here for testing purpose 


from flask import Flask, request
from flask_restful import Resource, Api
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from json import dumps

#Create a engine for connecting to SQLite3.
#Assuming salaries.db is in your app root folder

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

class Departments_Meta(Resource):
    def get(self):
        return {'departments': ['a','b','c']}


api.add_resource(Departments_Meta, '/departments')

if __name__ == '__main__':
     app.run()

paste this code into some file


now you will have to install required libraries swhich are 

pip install flask
pip install flask-restful
pip install sqlalchemy



finally run your python file using python command


Thatâ€™s it. Your salary API is up and running now on localhost , port 5000. There are two rules we defined in the API. One is to get details of all departments available and second is to get employee full detail, who is working in a particular department.

So now go to

http://localhost:5000/departments



that's it api is working 


now this is setting up the api in virtual environment which do not last long

next time we will set it up at live environment
